The entire process was extremely efficient due to Susie's responsiveness, professionalism and motivation. I was describing to Susie in short the essence of the company and the capabilities I'm looking for. Few days later, Susie sent me 3 CVs which suit exactly! She understands precisely company's needs and candidate's strengths and weaknesses. Susie interviewed the candidates and provided me with a clear opinion. I was amazed by her ability to find exactly the right people per our wish list: all three people suggested by her were a fit so we can easily choose. This story repeated each time we were working together - she succeeded to find excellent people within days. The manpower of a company, especially for a small start-up company as Otic is, is the most important asset the company has. Thank you Susie and L-il for a great contribution to Otic Pharma!"
